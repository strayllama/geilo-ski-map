# geilo-ski-map
Vite + React + TS

Shows live slop and lift open status (when ever they are updated on the resort site).
Labels are shown over the map to make knowing which areas are open/shut.
Since the website is just a list and only shows 1 level of slopes at any time.

Initialised in Bolt using AI prompts
